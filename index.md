Welcome! The goal of this first week is to give an introduction to some useful skills and concepts in data science, and leave you with some resources to learn more. Some things might be to totally new, while others might be familiar to you already.

## Schedule

Tuesday 10-12 and 1-3, JCC 502

Wednesday 10-12 and 1-3 JCC 502

Thursday 10-12 and 1-3 JCC 502

Friday 9:30-11 and 1:30-3:30 JCC 502

## Pre-workshop tasks

It will be helpful if you can complete tasks A and B below before Tuesday. But if you can't or you run into trouble, don't worry - we can also work through these steps together.

### Preworkshop task A: Git setup

1. If you have never used the terminal / command prompt before, go through this [introductory tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/). The commands you will need to know for this course are `ls` (for Mac and Linux users), `dir` (for Windows users), and `cd` (for everyone). (15 min)
2. Install Git, following these [instructions](https://karink520.github.io/git-and-github-intro/install_git.html). (10 min)
3. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com). (5 min)

### Preworkshop task B: Installing miniconda and a text editor:

Follow **steps 1, 2 and 7** (you can skip steps 3-6 for now- we'll come back to them) in these [setup instructions](https://karinknudson.com/python_setup.pdf). Again, if you have trouble or the instructions don't make sense, don't worry at all. We'll troubleshoot together in class. Note: if you already have miniconda or Anaconda and a text editor, you're all set.

### Preworkshop task C (optional): Python basics:

If you've never used Python before, check out the [Python basics notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-xnnJtSNYMwsizsR0q2Wc8Ys_jNt6srR). It is a Google collab notebook, so you will be able to run the code and see the output. Your task here is just to explore, see what you notice, and think about what questions you have. You can make changes to the code, but you won't be able to save them unless you make your own copy of the notebook (with the "Copy to Drive" button.

## Outline of the week

- Day 1 (Tuesday) - Python setup, cleaning and manipulating dataframes, Git and Github
- Day 2 (Wednesday) - Data visualization
- Day 3 (Thursday) - Machine learning
- Day 4 (Friday) - Machine learning, writing robust code with tests
