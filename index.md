## DIAMONDS Start of Summer Workshop

Welcome! The goal of this first week is to give an introduction to some useful skills and concepts in data science, and leave you with some resources to learn more. Some things might be to totally new, while others might be familiar to you already.

## Pre-workshop tasks

It will be helpful if you can complete the tasks below before day 1. But if you can't or you run into trouble, don't worry - we can also work through these steps together. 

### Preworkshop task A: Git setup

1. If you have never used the terminal / command prompt before, go through this [introductory tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/). The commands you will need to know for this course are `ls` (for Mac and Linux users), `dir` (for Windows users), and `cd` (for everyone). (15 min)
2. Install Git, following these [instructions]([install_git.md](https://karink520.github.io/git-and-github-intro/install_git.html). (10 min)
3. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com). (5 min)

### Preworkshop task B: Installing miniconda and a text editor:

Follow steps 1, 2 and 7 (you can skip steps 3-6 for now- we'll come back to them) in these [setup instructions](https://karinknudson.com/python_setup.pdf). Again, if you have trouble or the instructions don't make sense, don't worry at all. We'll troubleshoot together in class.

## Outline of the week
